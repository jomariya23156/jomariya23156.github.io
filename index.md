## Thailand Machine Learning for Chemistry Competition (TMLCC)

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_on_GitHub-blue?style=flat&logo=github&labelColor=grey)](https://github.com/jomariya23156/MOFs_CO2_prediction_TMLCC)
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_on_Devpost-blue?style=flat&logo=devpost&labelColor=grey)](https://devpost.com/software/project-9zuw48p5gokl?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_Jupyter_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter&labelColor=grey)](notebook_htmls/tmlcc_main_notebook.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">
TMLCC is a new type of Data Science competition in which competitors need to use Machine Learning techniques in order to build and develop mathematic models with the ability to learn and understand the relationship between structural properties of <b>Metal-Organic frameworks (MOFs) and their Working Capacity</b>. The developed models need to be able to predict this property of other MOFs accurately and precisely.   
Briefly given a number of features of chemistry properties and molecule files, the goal is to predict the CO2 Working Capacity (how much the MOFs can absorb CO2) in mL/g. Hence this is the regression task.
</div>

We placed in <b>6th place from over 200+ teams nationwide</b>. Here are the main techniques we applied that made us stand out:
- Create many new features from feature engineering with domain expertise in Chemistry subject.
- Fill missing values in some features with Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) technique and Chemistry formula.
- Select features using backward elimination along with [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) values.
- Do hyperparameters tuning with [Optuna](https://optuna.org/).
- Use [DeepInsight](https://github.com/alok-ai-lab/DeepInsight) to transform tabular data into images and train a downstream CNN model.
- Use the trained CNN as a feature extractor to extract more features and append them to train along with other original features with [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This gave us the best standalone model! 
- Ensemble models with a weighted average strategy by giving higher weight to the results from more accurate models.
