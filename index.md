<div style="text-align: justify">
Implemented a Zoom-like feature: Real-time webcam background replacement with a Web UI + Cartoonification + Image filters with FastAPI using WebSocket. (Also, utilizes JavaScript for frontend functionalities). Here are the main features of this app:
- Replace the webcam background with a selected prepopulated image or one uploaded by the user.
- Two available models for background segmentation: <b>Mediapipe</b> (default) and <b>'apple/deeplabv3-mobilevit-xx-small' from Hugging Face</b>.
- Cartoonify webcam stream with two options: <b>OpenCV</b> (Sequence of image processings) and <b>CartoonGAN</b> (Deep learning model).
- Apply filters to the webcam stream. Available filters include Grayscale, Saturation, Brightness, Contrast.
- Supports concurrent connections.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Implemented Flask web application login page including face verification (1-to-1 to verify whether the person who is logging in is really that person), for security purpose, with liveness detection mechanism (to check whether the person detected on the camera is a <b>REAL</b> person or <b>FAKE</b> (eg. image, video, etc. of that person)), for Anti-Spoofting (Others pretending to be the person), built with Convolutional Neural Network. After the login page, a webpage placeholder is also provided for future use.
